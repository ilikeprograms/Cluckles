Cluckles
=====================

[![Flattr this git repo](http://api.flattr.com/button/flattr-badge-large.png)](https://flattr.com/submit/auto?user_id=ilikeprograms&url=https://github.com/ilikeprograms/Cluckles&title=Cluckled Live Theme Editor&tags=github&category=software)

Cluckles Live Theme Editor for CSS Framework based on Less such as Twitter Bootstrap.
There is an example page provided (`build/example/index.html`) which makes it easy to see it in action!

There is also a Live demo which can be found at:
`http://cluckles.com`

The example demo page has a User Interface which has panels where you can change the different parts
of bootstrap by using color pickers to change the styling. Simple and Easy.
You can even add Custom Less/CSS and import/export it!

The included files can be distributed and used in other projects to provide live editing functionality for Bootstrap.
The files are also available on bower.

## Quick Start

- Download the Project by either `cloning` or `forking`. (Then CD into Cluckles)
- Alternatively Cluckles is available on `Bower` as `cluckles`
- Install dependencies by running `npm install` and `bower install`
- Run `Grunt` to build the files and open the example demo page in the browser
- Take a look at the demo!

## Getting started

To begin, download the repository from Git either by using the *Clone in Desktop* button, or download from Github:

### Downloading

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ilikeprograms/Cluckles
cd Cluckles
```

### Installing the Dependencies

Now you can start to install the dependencies. `Grunt` is used for build the JS files, and `Bower` for the JS files it depends on.
This means that `Node.js` and `NPM` needs to be installed on your system. To get Grunt/Bower to work, run the following commands

```shell
npm install
bower install
```

### Build Files

There should be a *build* directory which contains the `cluckles-x.x.x.js` file which is the main distribution file.
This can be taken out from the project and will provide the live editing functionality.
It does however rely on the files in `build/js/lib` and `build/less`. The `build/js/lib` files however could be replaced with newer versions and should work ok.
If you have a dependency on a specific version of `jquery` for instance, just replace the file.

### Changing the Build

The files in `src` and `bower_components` directories are used in the Build process to create the files in the `build` directory.
If you change the source files in the `src` directory, you will need to rebuild. `Grunt` is used for the build.

To build the project files just run the `grunt` command from the main directory. This will then make grunt run the default task which will build the files.

It will also automatically host a localhost server at http://localhost:9000/example which will host `the build/example/index.html` page
and open a tab in the browser at the address. It will also watch for changes to the source file and automatically rebuild for you,
if any changes are made.

### Changing/Viewing Docs Files

The docs are powered by `jekyll` and `Github pages`. When the project is build, the dist files are copied to the docs folder, that the build files can be used in the Live demo.  

To preview the Live demo to test them, run the following command from the command line:

```shell
jekyll --serve --base-url=
```

Then go to the browser and go to the url:  
`http://localhost:4000`
